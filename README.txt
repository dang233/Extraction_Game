=== General Overview

You first start off in a ship with only a blaster
equipped. Your bottom left consists of your health
bar, which can be upgraded, and your energy bar,
which is used to cast attacks. The exp bar will level
up if you kill an enemy. The combo meter indicates
how much more damage you will be able to do. The more
enemies you kill, the higher your combo will
get. Use your navigation to locate to the
nearest planet to repair your ship. To interact
with planets, get next to the green dot of a planet
and press "e". This will bring up the menu listing
options for "Quest", "Shop", "Charge" and "Repair.
Press quest to spawn enemies to battle and earn
money. To spend money on upgrades, click on 
the "shop" icon and select an upgrade. Different
planets have different upgrades to watch out for
them! Repairing the health or recharging
the energy of your ship will cost 500. Enemies
will get harder the longer you play so watch out!

The ultimate goal of the game is to defeat the 3
bosses that will be prompted once you reach a certain
point of advancement. Click on the prompt key
to spawn that boss.

You have 5 lives. Don't mess up.
